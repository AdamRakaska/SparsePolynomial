# Polynomial
Univariate polynomial class that only tracks non-zero terms. 


* Supports **symbolic** univariate polynomial arithmetic including:
   * Addition
   * Subtraction
   * Multiplication
   * Division
   * Modulus
   * Exponentiation   
   * GCD of polynomials
   * Irreducibility checking
   * Polynomial evaluation by assigning to the invariant (X in this case) a value.
   * Base-m expansion; Given a number and a base, a polynomial will be generated for you.


**Note: All arithmetic is done symbolically. That means the result a arithmetic operation on two polynomials, returns another polynomial.**


* Other methods of interest:
   * Eulers Criterion
   * Legendre Symbol and Legendre Symbol Search
   * Tonelli-Shanks
   * Chinese Remainder Theorem
